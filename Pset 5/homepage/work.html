            My career vision is based on the desire to create <b>significant social and economic contribution through <i>technology innovation</i></b>. This would become possible only if we ride the forces of disruptive technology, which, I believe, can be achieved by fostering cross-field innovation in order to maximize the economic benefits. <br>

            Being the lead of several strategic and successfully delivered projects at Opel, allowed me to become proficient in delivering strong results no matter how challenging the environment might be. <br>
